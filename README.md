# Liver-Disease-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
This project uses machine learning models to predict liver disease based on patient data. It includes data preprocessing, feature scaling, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation with Decision Tree, Random Forest, and SVM classifiers. Random Forest was found to perform best on this dataset.
